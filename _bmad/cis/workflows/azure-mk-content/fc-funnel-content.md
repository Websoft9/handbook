# FC Workflow: Funnel Content Strategy

**Goal:** Map comprehensive content strategy across conversion funnel stages (Visitor → Trial → Paid Customer) with key messaging, pain points, content types, and success metrics for each stage.

---

## Step 1: Product Context

Ask user for:
- **Product name:** (e.g., WordPress, AI Workflow Suite)
- **Target audience:** (e.g., DevOps teams, e-commerce businesses)
- **Primary value proposition:** (e.g., reduce ops time, eliminate tool sprawl)
- **Current traffic sources:** (Azure Marketplace / Organic search / Paid ads / Social / Email)

---

## Step 2: Funnel Stage Framework

### Stage 1: Visitor (Awareness)

**Target audience state:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware

**Key messaging:**

**Content types needed:**
- **Azure Marketplace listing:** Optimized title, summary, description (SEO-focused)
- **Landing page:** High-conversion hero section, pain points, benefits
- **Blog posts:** "Top 5 [Category] Tools for [Use Case]", "How to Choose [Software]"
- **Comparison guides:** "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]"
- **Video content:** 60-90 sec product overview, use case demos

**Success metrics:**
- **Traffic volume:** Visitors to Azure Marketplace listing, landing page
- **Engagement:** Time on page, pages per session
- **Search visibility:** Keyword rankings, impression share

## Step 3: Multi-Touchpoint Traffic Loop

Design for consistent experience across channels:

### Traffic Loop: Marketplace → Landing Page → LinkedIn → YouTube

**Touchpoint integration:**
- **Azure Marketplace listing** links to: Landing page, documentation, video demo
- **Landing page** links to: Azure Marketplace (deploy), case studies, video tutorials
- **LinkedIn posts** link to: Blog posts, landing page, Azure Marketplace
- **YouTube videos** link to: Landing page, Azure Marketplace, GitHub repo
- **Email campaigns** link to: Specific landing page sections (#pricing, #case-studies)

**Consistency requirements:**
- **Messaging:** Same value proposition across all channels
- **Branding:** Consistent logo, color scheme, tone of voice
- **CTAs:** Aligned calls-to-action ("Deploy Now", not mixed with "Try Free")

**UTM tracking:**
- Add UTM parameters to all cross-channel links
- **Example:** `?utm_source=azure-marketplace&utm_medium=offer-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress-launch`
- Track which touchpoints drive highest conversion

## Step 4: Content Calendar & Prioritization

### High-Priority Content (Create First):
1. **Azure Marketplace listing** - Core discovery channel (40% algorithm weight on title)
2. **Landing page** - Main conversion point after discovery
3. **Getting Started guide** - Critical for trial activation
4. **Email nurture sequence** - 7-email trial conversion engine
5. **Demo video** - 60-90 sec overview for quick value demonstration

### Medium-Priority Content (Create Next):
6. **Case studies** - Social proof for Stage 1 (Visitor) and Stage 2 (Trial)
7. **Blog posts** - SEO traffic driver, thought leadership
8. **Comparison guides** - Competitive differentiation

### Lower-Priority Content (Create When Resources Allow):
10. **Webinars** - Live engagement, high-touch sales
11. **Community forum** - Peer support, reduces support burden
12. **Advanced tutorials** - Power user feature adoption

**Content production cadence:**
- **Month 1:** High-priority content (1-5)
- **Month 2:** Medium-priority content (6-9)
- **Month 3+:** Lower-priority content (10-12) + ongoing blog posts
