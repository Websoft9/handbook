# KW Workflow: SEO Keyword Research

**Goal:** Identify high-impact keywords and recommend optimal placement strategy for Azure Marketplace listings.

---

## Step 1: Product Context

Ask user for:
- **Product/Category name:** (e.g., WordPress, DevOps Suite, CMS)
- **Target audience:** (e.g., DevOps engineers, e-commerce businesses)
- **Primary use cases:** (e.g., CI/CD automation, workflow automation)

---

## Step 2: Keyword Research

Conduct keyword analysis for Azure Marketplace listing using SEO best practices:

### High-Search-Volume Keywords:
- Identify keywords aligned with product/industry
- Consider: Brand names (WordPress, Jenkins), technology terms (CI/CD, workflow automation), use cases (e-commerce platform, content management)

### Keyword Categories:
1. **Brand keywords:** Specific software/app names (highest intent)
2. **Technology keywords:** Platform/stack terms (Azure, Docker, self-hosted)
3. **Use case keywords:** Problem/solution terms (automation, deployment, management)
4. **Compliance keywords:** Regulatory terms (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) if applicable

### Search Volume Considerations:
- Prioritize keywords with proven Azure Marketplace search activity
- Balance search volume vs. competition
- Consider buyer intent (informational vs. transactional)

---

## Step 3: Competitor Keyword Analysis

Analyze competitor listings:
- Identify common keywords in successful competitor listings
- Find keyword gaps (opportunities competitors missed)
- Avoid excessive overlap (differentiate positioning)

---

## Step 4: Placement Strategy Recommendations

### Title (40% algorithm weight):
- **Core keywords:** 1-2 highest-priority keywords
- **Position:** Front-load important keywords
- **Example:** "WordPress on Azure" vs "Azure Platform for WordPress"

### Summary (30% algorithm weight):
- **Keyword density:** Include 2-3 core keywords naturally
- **First 50 characters:** Critical for algorithm and user attention
- **Example:** "Deploy WordPress, Joomla & 15+ CMS tools..."

### Description (20% algorithm weight):
- **Minimum usage:** 4x repetition of core keywords throughout content
- **Natural placement:** Integrated into value propositions and benefits
- **Section headers:** Include keywords in `<h3>` tags where natural

### Search Keywords field (3 max):
- **Rule:** Keywords NOT already in Title
- **Strategy:** Complementary terms to expand discovery
- **Example:** If Title has "WordPress", use Search Keywords for "CMS", "blog platform", "content management"

### Video metadata (10% algorithm weight):
- **Video title:** Include core keywords
- **Video description:** Repeat keywords naturally
- **Thumbnail text:** Display keyword overlay if possible

---

## Step 5: Partner Center Search Logic Alignment

Explain how Azure Marketplace search works:
- **Title keywords** carry highest weight (40%)
- **Exact matches** rank higher than partial matches
- **Category selection** filters search results (correct category = higher visibility)
- **Freshness factor:** Recently updated listings get temporary boost

---

## Step 6: Keyword Density Recommendations

For Description content:
- **Target:** 4-6 repetitions of primary keyword
- **Distribution:** Spread naturally across sections
- **Avoid:** Keyword stuffing (unnatural repetition)
- **Context:** Always prioritize readability over keyword count

---

## Step 7: Output Recommendations

Present findings as:

### Recommended Keywords (Priority Order):
1. [Primary keyword] - [estimated search volume/competition]
2. [Secondary keyword 1] - [rationale]
3. [Secondary keyword 2] - [rationale]

### Placement Strategy:
- **Title:** [specific keyword placement recommendation]
- **Summary:** [specific keyword integration suggestion]
- **Description:** [section-by-section keyword distribution]
- **Search Keywords field:** [3 complementary terms]
- **Video metadata:** [keyword integration for video content]

### Competitor Analysis Summary:
