## Chapter 1 Introduction to the guide
In recent years, many business leaders have turned to online marketplaces to find new corporate technology solutions. Microsoft has made digital marketplaces such as Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace available to its community of customers and partners. These digital “storefronts” allow customers to find, try, buy, and deploy applications and services that accelerate their digital transformation, and help publishers like you grow your business, thanks to increased access to Microsoft’s customers and partner ecosystem. Microsoft invites you to take advantage of this opportunity and has created this guide to help you get the most out of your marketing and sales efforts.

An optimized marketplace business profile and offer listings can help you accelerate your customer acquisition growth, and thus can play a significant role in your cloud business strategy. Get ready to list offers, provide customer trials, and connect with Microsoft customers and the greater partner community.

So where do you begin?
You will need to determine how best to leverage and market your new marketplace business profile and offer listings. This Best Practices Guide serves as a supplement to Microsoft’s commercial marketplace publisher guide. It is designed to provide you with marketing strategies and ideas that can help you draw more traffic to your business profile and offer listings and engage with online prospects in more meaningful ways. For step-by-step guidance on how to set up your business profile and offer listings in Partner Center, check out the documentation on creating a business profile and on creating a new offer.

## Chapter 2 Optimizing your business profile and offer listing
Microsoft will help drive qualified visitors to Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace. You will complete a business profile, detailing the expertise of your company, and offer listings, describing the benefits of your individual solutions. Your responsibility is to ensure the messaging and supporting content is differentiated, stands out among other companies and offers, and provides all the information a customer would need to feel comfortable reaching out to you, trying your product, and purchasing it. Simply listing your solution’s features and functionality in a bulleted list is not very compelling. Focus on communicating more than just what your company and solution does by articulating why prospects need to work with you. Effectively communicating your core value proposition and return on investment is paramount.

### Key benefits of optimizing your business profile and offer listing
1. Gain new leads with the power of Microsoft’s reach
2. Reach global markets with less complexity
3. Customize and curate offers from free trials to private offers
4. Make it easy for other partners and Microsoft sellers to share your solutions with others
5. Test and validate new product or service offers and market opportunities
6. Convert prospects to buyers faster
7. Lower your sales costs

### Business profile best practices
Below is a sample marketplace business profile with content best practice recommendations which will help you optimize your profile and maximize results:
- Get your prospects’ attention by asking a compelling benefit-based question and answering that your company can provide a positive impact.
- Speak to your target audience and industry; identify a pain point your company can solve.
- Call attention to your marquee offerings and the benefits they provide to your projects.
- Use quantifiable stats when possible.
- If your company offers services as well as software, showcase your Azure expertise with the Azure MSP badge.
- If your company offers services as well as software, your company’s advanced specializations showcase extensive validation of your expertise by Microsoft.
- Highlight your solution development expertise with solutions partner designations
- Carefully select your services, categories, industries, and product expertise to draw attention to how you best support your prospects.

### Optimizing your marketplace business profile and offer listing content
First impressions matter. Research shows it takes only seconds for a prospect to accept or reject your offering during the selection process. It is critical that you make your business profile and offer listings appealing so that they resonate immediately with your target audience. Consider optimizing your listings for search engines with a relevant title and keywords: external search engines will surface your marketplace offers to a broad audience, and the marketplace search engines will drive an actively engaged audience to your listing.

### Product vs offer
Your product is the software solution you’ve developed. Your offer is the way you package, present, and position your product to the market. Your offer includes aspects of deals including pricing plans, licensing and support provided. With the marketplace, you can create multiple public or private offers for a single product, and tailor them for specific target markets.

### Branding is important
Choosing a name for your offer is a key decision; consider an offer name that either matches the product you’re selling, or describes the parameters of the offer for your product. Avoid using technology-specific terms in your product name or acronyms unless they are broadly understood. If you plan to offer more products in the future, consider branding implications and how you might expand the name to include a family of products or solutions.

Benefit-based solution names are generally more effective than descriptive ones. Ideally, your offer name will communicate the core value customers will enjoy. Adding an industry-specific reference or indicator can increase relevance as well as conversion rates.

### Positioning your company for success
#### Product overview and description
In the offer listing “Overview” section, include the following components:
1. **Clearly stated product value proposition**
Before jumping into describing WHAT you are selling, in the main headline of your listing, tell prospects HOW your company or offer can positively impact their business. The core components of your value proposition should be conveyed up front and should answer the following:
    - What need or pain does it address?
    - Who will gain from it the most?

2. **Pique your target customer’s curiosity**
8 out of 10 people will read headlines, but only 2 out of 10 will read the accompanying text. If you immediately ask a relevant question, you will attract prospects and pique their curiosity. This results in increased engagement. The best questions to ask are those that are benefit or pain based. For example, you could ask, “Tired of wasting valuable time and money manually processing invoices?” or “Want to reduce your invoice processing time by 20%?”

3. **Identify pain points before benefits and features**
Consider emotional messaging structure as you describe your offer and position it for your prospects.

| Approach | Messaging example |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | Non-emotion-generating feature: We offer inventory management. |
| Better | Somewhat emotionally appealing benefit: Increase your revenue and decrease your costs with more efficient inventory management. |
| Best | Emotionally compelling and action- driven statement: Stop losing revenue and customers due to stock outs and poor inventory management. |

Further engage customers by eliciting an emotional response. If you want to list features on your offer listing, begin your statement by identifying the pain, followed by the benefit, and then conclude with the features.
For example:
Is production downtime costing you money? (pain) Now you can automatically determine the primary reason for production gaps and high related costs. (benefit) Our solution offers full maintenance management and preventative maintenance functionality. (feature)

4. **Target customers**
Indicate who your company offering is intended for, so customers know when they read the title and description if it is designed for them. Does your company work with small businesses or large enterprises? Is your target audience an IT pro or a Business Decision Maker? In which regions is your offer available? Be clear and descriptive.

5. **Don’t forget proof testimonials**
Include a quote, customer testimonial, or statistic confirming the benefit of your company or solution. Prospects want proof of any claims that you make. Customers heavily rely upon the opinions of other customers when making their purchasing decisions. For your offer listing, we strongly encourage you to build up user reviews. While nurturing your customers postsale, you can encourage them to post reviews of their experience. Having ratings and reviews will help drive engagement in your offer listing, help your listing surface to the top of search results, and result in increased customer conversion rates.

### Supporting content for your offer listing
#### Screen shots and videos
When scanning text, the brain quickly tires and moves on. Include images and videos to show rather than tell users about potential benefits and impact of your offer. What can you include that effectively demonstrates your key value proposition in pictures rather than text? More effective than text are videos, product demonstrations, customer stories, solution screenshots, charts/graphs, and dashboards.

Videos generate a much higher level of engagement and viewing time, while conveying more than you can ever say with words. Ideal video length is less than 2 minutes. Videos can also be used across multiple channels including YouTube and social media and can be amplified through influencers where relevant. This is important because the initial cost of a video can be offset by the demand it creates and the fact that it can be leveraged on other social channels. Microsoft’s commercial marketplace allows you to add images and videos to your offer listing, so be sure to take advantage of this opportunity.

#### Style and production best practices for videos
- Speak directly to your prospects, using “you” rather than third person language such as “customers” or “they.”
- Post your video on YouTube or another highly accessible video platform and make it easily shareable via email, LinkedIn, and other social media.
- The ideal length of videos is 90 seconds (minimum 30 seconds/maximum 2 minutes).
- Make sure you underscore your visuals with high quality audio.
- Add interactivity wherever possible, linking to text, charts, animation, etc.
- Consider factors that impact accessibility, like captioning, alt text, and clear visual contrasts, to ensure your content is inclusive for all your prospects.
- Include a call to action at the end of all videos. Viewers should feel inspired to take the next step toward purchasing.
- Track views and measure viewer patterns so that you can learn from prospects’ actual behaviors and identify preferences to improve future content.
- Let prospects view what they are most interested in seeing; product demos should be less than 5 minutes long.
- Keep in mind that videos featuring a customer as the hero are more powerful than those in which you tell your own story.

#### Help your audience learn more about your offer
After you’ve used the overview section to deliver a concise, engaging message about your offer you can provide additional resources and information that users can link to in the “Learn More” section. This section is ideal for linking to additional collateral like brochures, white papers, or even customer case studies. You might also use this section to link to compliance or certifications your offer has attained.

#### Leverage ratings and reviews
Customer advocacy can be the biggest driver of sales as prospects tend to consider peer reviews before making a buying decision. Having multiple, strong customer reviews helps bump up your offer in search results. Invite new customers to try your solution and leave a review. Make sure to check your reviews frequently!

#### Provide a tangible experience
Customers like to try before they buy. When browsing apps, many marketplace visitors will filter offers by “Free trial” or “Free plan.” The stronger your trial experience, the more interested your prospects will be. Having a trial or freemium option will also unlock greater go-to-market support and benefits from Microsoft to help drive offer growth.

#### Consider product positioning
Customers often compare solutions, so it is important to differentiate your profile and offers from your competitors’ profile and solutions. Before you finalize your listing, benchmark your messaging and content against that of competitors.

#### Differentiation checklist
- Have you clearly highlighted the value your solution offers customers?
- Is the messaging on your listing different from that of competitors?
- Have you identified key compelling business pains and benefits, rather than just listing features?
- Have you mentioned who will benefit most from your solution? Does your messaging speak to a specific buyer persona?
- Do you provide prospects with a self-driven buying journey?

## Chapter 3 Sales landing page
Once you have successfully optimized your marketplace business profile and offer listings, you will want to create a dedicated sales landing page to educate prospects who need additional information. The Microsoft brand is powerful and compelling and will attract buyers; however, you may need to engage visitors further to convert them into customers. A sales landing page allows you to provide additional information to convince your prospects to buy, and allows you to capture contact information so you can educate them further.

Instead of sending prospective customers to your corporate home page where they may get lost, create a dedicated sales conversion page hosted on your domain. Be sure to provide a link to this page under the overview/description area on your Microsoft marketplace listing. Perform ongoing testing to optimize interaction levels on this landing page.

### Sales landing page best practices
Review the following sample sales landing pages and recommended approaches and determine which elements will help you become more successful.
- Leverage your brand to give your solution credibility
- Visuals create an emotional connection. Paint a desirable picture of your customers’ future situation.
- Do not give your prospects too many menu choices. Narrow the scope of the buying journey, and give your prospects the option to sign up for a nurture experience.
- State your value proposition early on the page.
- Pain leads to action. Identify 1-3 of your prospects’ most prominent challenges.
- Highlight a prominent next step, like trying or buying.
- Include videos to tell your story.

## Chapter 4 Go-to-market campaigns
Having an optimized business profile, offer listing, and sales landing page enables you to leverage the marketplace opportunity to gain traction. Just by listing in the marketplace you will gain access to marketing and sales benefits from Microsoft (via Marketplace Rewards) to help accelerate your offer growth. However, you will also want to conduct your own marketing campaigns, which will create greater awareness and drive ongoing demand for your solution. Listed below are critical, foundational steps that must be taken prior to executing your marketing campaigns. Take time to complete each step to ensure your campaign investment yields a high return.

1. **Define your target market**
To effectively drive traffic to your marketplace solution listing or profile, focus your marketing campaign efforts. Begin by defining high potential target market segments. A segment refers to a group of potential customers who share common characteristics, needs, and buying behaviors. Each market segment is unique; therefore, you will need to refine your content so that you can provide relevant emails, blogs, and other content that speaks directly to these prospects while addressing their business challenges. Examples of market segments could include small businesses, emerging mid-size companies, or large enterprises.

**Know your key decisionmakers**
    - What are their primary pains and challenges?
    - What do they most want to achieve?
    - What drives their decision making?
    - Who influences them?
    - What is most important to them?

2. **Be specific about the industries you serve**
Prospects want to know if your solution is optimized specifically for their business needs. Make sure to demonstrate your domain expertise and the value of your product by creating and sharing industry-specific case studies, by providing industry specific landing pages, and writing blogs that highlight key challenges facing your target industries.

Microsoft AppSource leverages industry specific categories for refining search queries. Take advantage of these filters if you have industry-specific solutions that your customers are searching for.

**Reference example**:
Microsot | AppSource N
Browse by industries
Eengy

3. **Be specific about the category your solution represents**
Prospects browse and search by category to find the solutions they need. In both Microsoft AppSource and the Azure Marketplace, categories help your solution highlight the functionality it offers.

Selecting appropriate solution categories also increases your offer’s score, making it more likely that your solution will be featured in the marketplace.

**Reference example**:
Mrosoft| Aure Marketace A Cotng eie
Browse apps
Get slarted
Antas
Cortare
Dm Op
Moo irtD

Microsoft | Appource
Browse apps by categories

4. **Speak to a specific persona**
Drafting an email, blog, advertisement, or other marketing asset that appeals to a broad mass market can be quite challenging. We often try to create content that resonates with all prospective buyers, but in doing so, we don’t reach any one prospect in a meaningful way. The needs of an IT Manager are different from those of a Marketing VP or CEO. Prospects will only spend a few seconds scanning your marketplace business profile, offer listing, and landing page, or reading your email. Identify WHO your solution is for at the top of your page, so that visitors can immediately know they have come to the right place, and that you have a solution just for them.

| Target audience | Roles |
| --- | --- |
| Line of business decision makers | procurement, manufacturing, accounting, etc. |
| IT professionals, developers | DBAs, SecOps, DevOps, etc. |

5. **Have a well-defined content strategy**
Your prospects are very busy. In addition to fulfilling their many responsibilities, they are overwhelmed with daily emails pertaining to sales and marketing offers from outside firms. Most importantly, they often don’t trust the content of sales materials or advertisements as much as they used to. This means you should focus less on selling and more on educating.

All of your campaign content should teach prospects during the buying cycle, rather than focus solely on product features and functionality. You earn trust by providing information that is valuable to your prospects. This can include sharing:
    - Interesting industry data or research
    - Summaries of key trends
    - Case studies and success stories
    - Checklists, guides, and self-assessments
    - Educational blogs on important industry specific topics
    - Other informative content

When offering this content, capture contact information from your prospects so you can nurture them with additional valuable information.

6. **Avoid using too much emotionless text**
Most vendors use too much text in their marketing materials and communications. Adding an image to an email has been proven to increase open rates. Email open rates are tied to sender name and subject line. In fact, if you have an image in your email and the recipient doesn’t have images enabled in the preview pane or full view, it won’t count as an open. Provide a link to a video or demo to encourage prospects to move to the next step in the discovery journey. Include a link to your marketplace offer listing on all your marketing assets. Attract buyers’ attention, show them something they won’t want to miss, and stand out from the rest! Include dashboards, images, and other graphics in campaign content to deepen visual interest and increase consumption time.

7. **Make video the hero of your campaigns**
Online video is the future of content marketing. Why? In our world of information overload, video is easy to engage with. Your campaign strategy should include video content. Even if you operate a small business, you can inexpensively create authentic customer stories, educational videos, employee video blogs, and more. Share your videos on your website, embed links in your email campaigns, and post your videos on social media. Include a direct link to your marketplace business profile and offer listing at the end of all your videos. Be sure to consider factors that impact accessibility, like captioning, alt text, and clear visual contrasts, to ensure your content is inclusive for all your prospects.

8. **Keep your campaign content simple**
Keep your messaging clear and to the point. Use language your customers would use to describe their needs or challenges, rather than using polished marketing verbiage. An abundance of text will be largely ignored. On your business profile, listing pages, conversion landing pages, and in campaign emails, try eliminating everything that isn’t compelling or important.

**How to engage and not overwhelm the buyer’s mind**
    - Include lots of white space and text
    - Use simple, descriptive, ordinary language
    - Avoid emotionless stock photos
    - Tell your story in infographic form
    - Incorporate videos, trials, demos, and interactive content
    - Add subtitles or bullet points to break up text

9. **Set up campaign tracking**
Once you set up your own marketing campaign, you can use campaign tracking codes to measure the campaign results. With “OCID” tracking codes you can measure visitors and Call To Action (CTA) clicks for things like your marketing campaigns, social media posts, blogs, nurture emails, or any activity that is directed to your marketplace offer listing. The OCID tag or identifier enables you to track all user traffic and lets you better assess the effectiveness of those tactics in driving listing engagement.

**How to properly implement OCID tracking codes for Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace listings**
1. Select URL: Identify the Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace listing for your campaign.
    - Azure Marketplace example: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en- us/marketplace/apps/Contoso.WorkflowOptimization
    - Microsoft AppSource example: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en- us/product/office/WA104380627
2. URL clean up: Remove ‘tab=overview’ from the listing’s URL. If there is no ‘tab=overview’, then add “?” at the end. Make sure there is only 1 ‘?’ before OCID:
    - Azure Marketplace example: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en- us/marketplace/apps/Contoso.WorkflowOptimization?
    - Microsoft AppSource example: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en- us/product/office/WA104380627?
3. Create your own “campaign name” after “OCID”, this could be any word that ties activities together, such as campaign, mktgcampaign, aprilcampaign. You can give each activity a unique identifier, or if you have multiple activities as part of a single campaign, you could use a common name as the identifier such as “aprilcampaign” so that you can easily group all activity results as part of that campaign.
    - Action: Add “ocid=campaignname_” after the “?” in the URL:
    - Azure Marketplace example: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en- us/marketplace/apps/ Contoso.WorkflowOptimization?ocid=campaignname_
    - Microsoft AppSource example: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en- us/product/office/WA104380627?ocid=campaignname_

Contact your Marketplace Rewards engagement manager to get reporting details on your OCID campaign tracking codes.

10. **Get featured on the commercial marketplace**
Azure Marketplace and AppSource have popular apps sections, where you can get your app featured. The selection algorithm generates a score to an app by Microsoft, just like a person's credit score in the US. The weekly selection of featured solutions is based on a calculation of solution and service performance.

You can take the following actions to improve your score:
- Ensure that your solution or service is appropriately categorized: Choose three categories that represent your solution’s capabilities.
- Grow your Azure consumption month-over-month. For Azure Marketplace solutions, if you're able to achieve 1,000 hours of Azure usage a month, you'll greatly increase your chances of being featured.
- Increase the acquisitions coming to your offer. For AppSource solutions, if you're able to achieve 10 acquisitions per month, you'll greatly increase your chances of being featured.
- Achieve co-sell ready status: Complete the requirements to make your solution co-sell ready.
- Improve the quality of your offer: See content listing guidelines for information on how to modify your offer.
- Publish multiple offers in Marketplace: Are all your core solutions and services listed? Do you have a trial experience?
- Encourage your customers to write reviews.

Popular Apps promotions operate separately from the search algorithm.

## Chapter 5 Techniques for driving traffic to your listing
You now understand the critical steps required to launch marketing campaigns that engage viewers and bring results. Here are some quick tips on how to draw greater traffic to your solution listing and sales landing page:
1. Indicate on your website and other marketing communications that your product or solution offering is available on Microsoft’s commercial marketplace, and that customers can easily access a trial offer there. Include social media share buttons on online pages and provide a link back to the marketplace. You can leverage the “Get it from” badges in our Marketplace Marketing Toolkit to promote your listing in content, web pages, or other sales or marketing collateral.
    - Get it from Microsoft Azure Marketplace
    - Get it from Microsoft AppSource
    - “Get it from” badges
2. Use trusted, well-researched, and targeted industry terms to increase search rankings. Take advantage of keyword planning tools to choose your words more effectively. Visit the Microsoft Advertising Keyword Planner or Google Ads Keyword Planner to get started.
3. Interact with those in your target segment. Make your presence known at industry events and conferences so that you can position your organization as a thought leader. Have links to your website posted on industry blogs, newsletters, and other relevant online publications. Show that you are an active member in your prospects’ community. Cross links will help increase your search engine rankings as well.
4. Adopt the “conversational marketing” trend by engaging in two-way communication, creating a customer community, and aiming to provide customers and prospects with more than just a product experience. Create and post shareable educational videos. Help your customers gain recognition for their innovative implementations and showcase their successes. Leverage the power of referrals and focus on nurturing customer advocates.
5. Create links between channels (e.g., from your marketplace business profile and offer listing to your website, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, etc.). Leverage the “Get it from” badge in the Marketplace Marketing Toolkit. Whatever platforms you are using, if you create a network between all of your touchpoints, you will be sure to gain an increase in traffic flow.

## Chapter 6 Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), and display media advertising
To increase the chances that your listing will be found on Microsoft’s commercial marketplace, you should also apply search engine optimization (SEO) best practices. SEO refers to the process of optimizing your business profile, offer listing, and sales conversion page so that they will appear high in organic search results. Search engines regularly send automated, web- surfing software called "crawlers" out into the web to review and analyze website pages, searching for any updates and changes. These crawlers are gatekeepers to a search engine’s ranking system. The more relevant your landing page updates are for the customer, the more frequently these crawlers re-analyze your listing, which benefits you.

Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace also let prospects find your business profile and offer listing using specific category filters. Be sure to align with these key search terms if you have industry domain expertise or workload specialization.

In addition to web search, users will also be able to find your business profile and offer listings using the marketplace search engine located in the top navigation bar of each storefront. Buyers can search by offer name, publisher, or specific keywords to get a filtered list of results. The marketplace search engine will render search results using a weighted scoring model. The search term used by the customer will be matched against the offer’s title, the publisher name, the offer’s short and long description as well as the search keywords added to the offer during the publishing process. Each of these inputs is weighted and the search algorithm will yield results based on these weights. Therefore, to ensure the highest search scoring possible, any keywords tagged to the offer in Partner Center should also be included in the content of the product detail page as well.

### Steps to boost your search ranking
#### Content and keyword optimization
1. Keyword research – look for keywords which communicate the message of your business or offer. Look at blogs, Reddit, Facebook, and other social media to see what people think about the page. Choose high monthly search volume keywords and add them to the body content and to the headers of your business profile and offer listing. Review your competition. Picking the same keywords as competitors or other vendors will drive up the price of those keywords.
2. Keyword optimization – it is also important to know how to use keywords and where to place them within your marketplace business profile and offer listing. Are you using keywords at least 4 times in your content? Does your listing title and first paragraph contain your most important keywords? Avoid practices such as duplicate content and keyword stuffing (adding keywords that don’t add value to the reader).
3. Content promotion – promote your content across channels, including your website and social media and build both internal and external links. Reach out to industry analysts, bloggers, partners, or other technology consultants for a review, a mention, or even just a quick link (within context of course) to your business profile or offer listing. It’s imperative to create outbound links to related content as well.

#### Make your content fresh and relevant
Your content should be specific on a given topic and be kept up to date. Modify your business profile, offer listing and sales conversion pages regularly. Update screen shots, videos, text, and more. Search engines demand that you keep your listing current to show up in search results. Make sure you have a consistent message across all channels. Think about how all message touchpoints connect to accelerate your customer’s decision.

### Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
You may also choose to invest funds into promoting your marketplace business profile, offer listings, and sales conversion page to increase visibility in search engine results. In other words, your page can achieve a higher ranking in search engine results and appear above the organic search results. This is referred to as search engine marketing (SEM) or pay-per-click (PPC).

### Digital media advertising
There are also many paid options to gain increased awareness and attract higher visitor volumes using targeted display or banner advertising. Because of the complexity involved, we recommend working with a media buying agency or expert who can help you target and optimize your initial media plan to yield the highest return on investment. Hiring an expert will help you learn best practices and avoid mistakes. Important steps include choosing the right medium, defining your target buyer, assessing costs, identifying goals, designing effective advertisements, optimizing campaigns, and measuring and tracking results.

## Chapter 7 Converting visitors into prospects
### Give prospects control
After you are successful in drawing attention to your business profile and offer listing, it is important to provide prospects with the next immediate step that will move them along the buying journey. Purchasers want control throughout their decision-making process; they decide when and how they get the information they need. It is therefore critical to provide as many engagement options as possible, so that they can plan their own buying journey. Trials should be customer-led and require no purchase or configuration.

### The strategic purpose and value of a free trial
When you offer a free trial and a competitor does not, you immediately have an advantage. You appear more trustworthy and transparent, leaving your prospect with a positive bias towards your company. The aim of offering a trial is to drive the visitor from interest to desire. A trial can help you demonstrate your solution’s value and nudge a prospect toward commitment and activation.

### Trial options
Offering prospects a trial experience increases engagement as well as exposure to your solution. 27% of app searches in the marketplace are filtered by users to look for solutions with trials. Without a trial you are decreasing your chances of being found by users.

There are different “trial” offer options, and each has its pros and cons. By providing more than one option to visitors, you allow them to choose their own experience, based on where they are in the buying journey. Below are three trial options you can offer prospects:

| Trial type | Key benefits | Choose this option if… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free trial | Enables customers to try your product before they buy and includes an automatic method to convert to paid use. Trials can be used to deliver proofs of concept for a customer or through joint engagement with Microsoft sales teams. | - Your solution is a virtual machine or solution template.<br>- Your offer is transactable.<br>- Your solution requires minimal configuration and time to value for your customers |
| Free plan | Enables customers to try your product with limited functionality, and allows them to purchase more advanced functionality as needed. | - Users need time with your product to realize value and build stickiness<br>- Maintaining free users doesn’t impose heavy costs to your organization |

A customer led free trial provides prospects with the most control over their trial experience. A free plan (also known as "freemium") offers basic functionality for free, with a charge for more advanced features. Prospects can chart their own paths and self-determine their interactions on their own schedules. You may be able to limit how long a prospect can interact with the trial environment to a single visit, to a number of single visits, or to the full length of a trial period. By keeping your trial short, you encourage prospects to increase engagement and you create a sense of urgency, which can also compress your sales cycle. Include a call-to-action to accelerate conversion to paid use of your solution.

### Benefits of a trial offer
- 32% of marketplace trials convert to sales
- 16% of free plans (“freemium” offers) convert to sales
- Trials enable Microsoft field sellers to better assess your product for co-sell efforts

Regardless of which type of trial you offer, structure it in a way that speaks to a specific buyer persona. Offer use case scenarios if possible. As outlined earlier, determine who your target buyers are and what is driving them to look for a solution. Then ensure your trial guides them through what is most important to them and addresses their concerns. Each buyer type will be interested in different capabilities and benefits, so your trial should reflect these variances in focused and compelling ways.

## Chapter 8 Effective trial nurture process
Once you capture prospects’ interest on the marketplace business profile or offer listing and they start a trial or engage with you, it is essential to have a clearly defined trial nurture process. The goal during a trial is to help the customer understand how your solution or service can address their enterprise concerns and challenges, which will trigger a deeper level of interest.

Whatever the duration of your trial, the nurture focus period should kick in as soon as possible and begin no longer than 14 days from the onset of customer explorations. This trial duration length is effective for the customer to evaluate and better understand the product value and be ready to engage in the next step of the purchase journey.

### Define a marketing nurture process
All your marketplace leads should be nurtured and monitored along a deliberate evaluation path and nurture process. Touchpoints for prospects benefit from being well executed-both during and after trial, workshop, proof of concept, or other engagement. For best results, you will need to proactively engaged and monitor, guide, and nurture potential customers along a path that actively removes obstacles, while encouraging high engagement and interest.

Your chosen nurture process will vary based on whether you have in-app intelligence to monitor trial user behavior throughout interaction with the solution being trialed. If you can gather these insights, you can trigger an action-based email sequence that gently nudges potential new customers towards a desired outcome. If trial users are overlooking key features, you can offer self-serve resources, tips, guides, tutorials, and other documentation, all of which help a higher product engagement and interest which deepens and is effective in being more apt to be ready to purchase.

For services or apps that lack a trial, you can plan a nurture track based on a timed sequence of pre-determined nurture emails. Striking a balance between staying top-of-mind and being aggressive is important. We recommend encouraging users to buy towards the end of this nurture sequence, after trust is earned and they have the depth to understand the capabilities and features of your solution offering.

### Nurture cycle
Regardless of the nurture track, the following types of emails are effective during the nurture cycle:
1. **Welcome Email**
It is important to welcome your trial user. This type of email has the highest open rate of any email at 60%. Within the email, explain the value that users can expect from your solution, and provide resources or guidance on how to encourage testing of your key features. Links to videos can be helpful as well.

2. **Education Email**
Send regular emails containing useful content designed to help users get the most out of your trial. Send practical guidance and tips that easily get started. Tell them you will be keeping in touch with them to ensure they have a positive learning experience.

3. **Aspiration Email**
In this email, describe an inspirational customer case that provides social proof and aligns with the outcomes your prospect is looking for.

4. **Trust & Thought Leadership Email**
Send an email that highlights your company's expertise, experience, and awards, and shows you are a safe choice. Create a sense of fear if prospects choose someone else or if they miss out on this opportunity to join the hundreds of other companies just like theirs that have enjoyed significant benefits with your solution.

5. **Urgency Email**
If possible, create in-app messaging to remind users of how much time is left in their trial period. Emails should state how many days they have left in their trial. This creates a sense of urgency.

6. **Offer Email**
Create a one-to-one email with a personalized, limited offer. Include a reminder of the key benefits prospects will enjoy with your solution.

7. **Take Away Email**
Send them a final email stating you will be removing them from the trial process. Allow them one last opportunity to opt into a marketing nurture program if they are still interested, but not yet ready to decide.

### Tracking leads
To receive leads from Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace, you can enable your CRM (e.g., Marketo, Microsoft Dynamics, or Salesforce) to accept lead data, or you can download lead data from Partner Center. All offer types, regardless of storefront, product integration, or billing capabilities, will receive leads. Review guidance on lead management in the marketplace to learn more.

### Best practices when engaging with new leads
1. Consider how you reach out: Social media outreaches (for example, on LinkedIn or Twitter) is not a replacement for an official email acknowledgement. It’s recommended to reach out to the customer with the information they provided for outreach. Outreach outside of those mediums may elicit negative customer response.
2. Personalized corporate email is best: Initial email outreach to new lead(s) will have a higher engagement if sent from a personalized official corporate email that is not a <no-reply@your company domain>
    - Emails that come from <no-reply> are often auto-filtered into junk and spam. Ensure your mails are received and read by using a personal touch as follow-up.
    - Including a phone number option for your customer to reach you also improves responsiveness. Many customers just want to pick up the phone and connect with someone real-time.
3. Provide context: Even though the customer provided consent for outreach, context goes a long way to helping create a great customer experience. Let them know who you are, how you’re connected to the offer they are interested in, trialed, or purchased, and let them know how you can support them with the offering. Avoid pushing a cross-sell or up-sell as this is not what the customer consented to when sharing their details.
4. Keep it transactional: When customers agreed to share their contact information in the marketplace, they agreed to be contacted with transactional communications and/or support for the product. They did not consent to marketing or promotional follow-up. Keep your customers happy by respecting these consent permissions.

### Lead scoring
Nurturing the customer post-purchase is key to retaining and gaining future business. Sales organizations often share the challenge of managing many leads from multiple resources. In order to leverage Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace as a significant channel, the first step would be to enable your CRM to accept lead data, and then to start tracking and managing these leads according to your existing lead management process. One of the most common methods is using lead scoring, which ranks leads to determine a lead’s salesreadiness. This mechanism will help focus your efforts and resources to drive for higher conversions - turn opportunities to wins. The marketplace supports many major CRM systems (e.g., Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Marketo, etc.).

Dynamics 365, for example, offers predictive lead scoring (PLS), which leverages advanced machine learning capabilities. Anyone in your sales organization can benefit from the resulting scores, not just a data scientist or IT pro. This mechanism works as follows:

#### Predictive lead scoring
- Model training: In this step, Dynamics 365 analyzes the performance of historical leads in your CRM and identifies patterns unique to your business, as they are learned from the data.
- Scoring: Each open lead is correlated with the pattern learned from your historical data and given a score. The higher the score, the more likely the lead is to convert.

Another significant insight is provided by scoring leads across different campaign types. The algorithm can indicate when more qualified leads came from a specific campaign (e.g., social network campaign) and score the lead accordingly. Dynamics 365 Sales Insights detects important features such as campaign type and learns from them to improve future scoring. In that sense, the marketplace allows you to easily identify leads that are more likely to convert.

Marketplace leads can be scored differently according to the type of listing. For example, leads that came from a transactable offer are more likely to be qualified than a lead generated from a Contact Me listing. Leads who clicked Trial have showed intent and therefore can become more significant in your pipeline. In some cases, you can get valuable information about the lead, such as company name, title, and geography. Remember that you can gather information about your prospects, such as visitors and call to action clicks by using campaign tracking. For more information, see chapter 4.

### Pricing
The commercial marketplace allows you to transact certain apps. There are varying transact capabilities between Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace. To see a full list of capabilities and differences check out the transact section of the Publisher Guide. You have Pay- as-You-Go and Bring-Your-Own-License billing options. When the Pay-as-You-Go Transact publishing option is used, your usage-based software licensing revenue is shared 97% / 3% between you and Microsoft, respectively. A single offer can be priced with both Pay-as-You-Go and Bring Your Own License billing models and can co-exist at the offer level as separate SKUs. This can be configured in your offer in Partner Center.

If directly transacting with customers on the marketplace is not available to you, and your prospects have completed a free trial or interactive demo, they will want to know if they can afford your solution. However, they may not yet be ready to engage with a salesperson to get a quote or proposal. Provide prospects with pricing information on your sales landing page and if possible, present them with sample packaged offers; this will allow them to get started with your solution right away. Shorten your sales cycle by giving prospects the opportunity to buy immediately after a trial.

Qualified partners can create professional services or consulting-type listings in both storefronts. This is a great opportunity to showcase your domain expertise and move the prospect from interest to purchase. The publishing requirements for this offer type are different from offers that are application-based, so visit the requirements in the publisher guide to determine if this is a useful opportunity for you. These offer types do not have a revenue share because they are meant to be a lead capture mechanism and not a transaction vehicle. They do, however, have a stated price, and you should consider how this affects the perception of your product detail page. You can frame your service prices as fixed or variable, based on the scope of the engagement. Think about how that will affect a customer’s understanding of what to expect from the service delivery.

To accelerate the buying decision, provide 3 or 4 different tiered packages. Your middle offering should ideally be your highest-margin, most popular option. A low entry package will encourage a quick buying decision and remove barriers to purchasing with potential for upselling later. A high-priced package will make the middle option more attractive and allow you to provide a premium option for more complicated implementations. In addition, consider offering fixed price, “quick start” 30-day-or-less deployments or a pilot project to speed up purchasing decisions.

### Other pricing considerations
- What is your pricing model today?
- What are you going to monetize with your offer? A feature set, or services, or both? This might depend on what a customer will be deploying from the storefront: is it a fully functional app, or is it a subset of your product’s full capabilities?
- Would one of the following standard pricing models apply to your feature set?
    - Flat rate, with monthly or annual billing
    - Billing per user, per consumption, or other usage-based (custom meter)
    - Billing per hour of consumption or usage
    - Hybrid (For example, flat rate plus a per usage fee)
- Would your sales organization need to shift their approach, based on the pricing

When a customer comes to your marketplace offer, they should be able to easily calculate what their “total cost of ownership” (TCO) should be. This means that answering the above questions for your marketplace product and having specific dollar or other currency amounts on your “plans + pricing” tab will help them move forward with confidence with a deployment.

## Chapter 9 Reporting and analysis
### Measure and optimize
Marketing is both an art and a science. Know what you want to achieve in terms of revenue generation and new customer acquisition. Set objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all your campaigns. Benchmark your monthly results and assess the impact of changes you make to your solution listing, landing page or trials along the way.

Set targets and regularly measure the following KPIs to gain insight and improve your business profile, offer listing, sales landing page, and campaigns:

#### Sales funnel efficiency
- Number of contacts/visitors generated per month
- Number of conversions from visitor to trial signup
- Number of conversions from trial to purchase
- Number of paying customers
- Average number of days in each stage of the funnel
- Annual churn rate

#### Track traffic source performance
You will use many different marketing media to promote your new solution, including your Microsoft marketplace listing, SEO, paid advertising, social media campaigns, targeted email campaigns, and more. Tracking prospects by lead source will be important to ensure marketing effectiveness. Closely track and measure your results by medium and lead source in relation to your goals to ensure a high return on your marketing investment, and to further refine your messaging when necessary.

Your success is our success. You can visit the Partner Center Insights dashboard to uncover your analytics. You can use it to monitor sales, evaluate performance, and optimize your offers in the marketplace. The improved analytics tools enable you to act on performance results and maintain better relationships with your customers and resellers.

#### Reports included in the Insights dashboard
- Summarize snapshot of orders
- Usage
- Deployments
- Customer trends
- Detailed orders, usage, and customer data
- Orders and usage listed in a monthly summary or as a trend view
- Usage/orders categorized based on several criteria
- Marketplace Insights reports with the following metrics:
    - Page visits
    - Unique visitors
    - Trends in page visits versus unique visitors
    - Trends by offer, campaign, and referral domain
    - Clicks on call to action buttons
    - Visitors by geography
    - Referral domains
    - Detailed reports showing

These metrics are provided with easy-to-read visualizations, as well as a data table function where you can download your data in a CSV file and pivot it based on filters that are important to your business. This allows you to analyze your data and compare it to data you might be extracting from other marketing automation tools, to get a view of your marketing impact and your overall marketplace business.

A recommended best practice is to decide on what Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you will measure for a campaign and use these reports to validate progress toward achieving these indicators.

#### Specific attributes we provide about your customers
- First name
- Reseller
- Last name
- Reseller Zip/Postal Code
- Email
- Transaction date
- Company name
- Subscription name
- Customer Countr Region
- Cloud Instance Name
- Customer City
- Order count
- Customer Communications Culture
- Azure subscription ID (PAY customers only)

#### Map prospect interactions
Knowing how many interactions (e.g., emails, demonstrations, content downloads, blog visits, etc.) it takes before a customer will sign up for a trial and convert to a buyer will enable you to plan and tailor your marketing efforts accordingly. This may take some time to determine, but the insight gained will be very valuable.

#### Marketing budget forecasts
Most vendors under-invest in marketing. Business-to-business firms typically spend between 7%-10% of their gross revenue on marketing. Allocate adequate budget to (a) ensure you have the marketing resources to follow up and qualify leads, (b) drive marketing nurture programs and campaigns, and (c) develop marketing content that educates prospects.

#### Questions to ask
When making marketing investment decisions and establishing budget and control measures, you can track the following in one place and stay on top of performance with a simple marketing key performance indicator dashboard:
- What is my allowable cost to acquire a new customer?
- What is the customer’s estimated lifetime value?
- What can I expect the average monthly value of each new customer to be?
- What is the average acquisition timeframe for each customer, in months?
- What is the expected annual churn rate?
