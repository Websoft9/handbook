# Category Suite Plan Template

This template is for individual SKUs within a category suite.

## Structure Guidelines

**Each Plan = One App** within the category suite

**Focus:** Specific tool value, use cases, "What You Get"

## PLAN NAME

**Format:** `[App Name] [Category] Suite`

**Examples:**

- `GitLab DevOps Suite`
- `n8n Workflow Automation Suite`

**Best Practices:**
- App name first (brand recognition)
- Category for context
- "Suite" signals part of larger offering
- 3-5 words

---

## PLAN SUMMARY

**Format:** `Self-hosted [App] for [primary use case] with one-click deployment and managed support`

**Examples:**
- `Self-hosted Jenkins for CI/CD automation with one-click deployment and managed support`

**Best Practices:**
- Highlight primary use case
- Mention key differentiator (one-click, managed, etc.)
