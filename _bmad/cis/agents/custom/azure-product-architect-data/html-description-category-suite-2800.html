<h3>You Deployed [PRIMARY_APP] Last Quarter. Now Your Team Needs More.</h3>

<p>Marketing wants [PRIMARY_APP] for [PRIMARY_USE_CASE]. Three months later, training team requests [APP_2] for [BUSINESS_TRIGGER_2]. Next quarter, sales needs [APP_3] for [BUSINESS_TRIGGER_3]. <b>Each time = 2 weeks explaining to your boss why the new project is delayed + $6,000 in engineer time.</b></p>

<p>What if adding the next app took 5 minutes instead of 2 weeks?</p>

<p><b>Deploy [PRIMARY_APP] today on [CATEGORY] Platform. Add [N]+ apps instantly when business needs change.</b> No re-deployment. No delays. No re-platforming costs.</p>

<h3>Sound Familiar?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>"We need [APP_2], but IT says it'll take 2 weeks to set up a new environment."</b> Every app request becomes a project. Your team waits. Competitors move faster.</li>
<li><b>"We're managing [CATEGORY] tools across 4 different VMs with 4 different backup systems."</b> Each tool needs separate maintenance windows. One misconfigured backup = data loss nightmare.</li>
<li><b>"Last year we deployed [APP_1]. This year we need [APP_2]. Apparently we have to rebuild everything?"</b> Your original setup wasn't built for growth. Now you're paying the re-platforming tax.</li>
<li><b>"Our Azure bill has line items we don't even recognize anymore."</b> Separate VMs, separate storage, separate networking. Costs spiral as your tool count grows.</li>
</ul>

<h3>One Platform. Every App. Zero Re-platforming.</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Deploy today's app in 10 minutes. Add tomorrow's in 5 minutes.</b> Marketing deploys [PRIMARY_APP] on Monday. Training adds [APP_2] on Friday. No tickets, no delays, no explaining why it takes 2 weeks.</li>
<li><b>Pay $15/month extra now. Avoid $6,000 re-deployment costs later.</b> Traditional approach: Every new app = new VM setup, data migration, testing, rollout. Platform approach: Click "Add App", done. That's growth insurance.</li>
<li><b>One backup schedule protects everything.</b> Configure backups once. Every app you add inherits the same protection. Compare that to managing backup configs across 4 separate VMs.</li>
<li><b>Cut software costs 40-60% vs SaaS.</b> Self-hosted [PRIMARY_APP], [APP_2], [APP_3] on your Azure subscription = predictable costs. No per-seat pricing. No surprise renewals. You control the budget.</li>
<li><b>Built for IT teams drowning in tool requests.</b> Unified management panel means you're not context-switching between 5 different admin dashboards. Deploy, monitor, backup, update—all from one place. Save up to 10 hours/week on routine DevOps tasks.</li>
<li><b>Test in your actual Azure environment before committing.</b> Deploy, run your real workloads, validate performance. If it doesn't work for you, you know <i>before</i> migrating production data.</li>
</ul>
