# BMB Creations - Agent Development Artifacts

This directory contains **BMad Method Builder (BMB)** generated documentation for agent creation and editing processes.

**Files:**
- `agent-plan-*.md`: Initial agent design document (goals, capabilities, persona definition)
- `edit-plan-*.md`: Complete edit history with decision rationale and session tracking
- `validation-report-*.md`: Quality check report validating metadata, persona, menu, and structure compliance

**Lifecycle:** Created during agent development → Reference for design decisions → Archive after agent stabilizes → Not required for agent runtime (agent runs independently of these files)
