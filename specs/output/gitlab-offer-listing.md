<h3>Why Choose Self-Hosted GitLab on Azure?</h3>

<p>Struggling with complex multi-step deployment requiring manual configuration, manual SSL certificate renewal and security patch management, or unpredictable infrastructure costs and performance bottlenecks? Websoft9 eliminates these pain points with production-ready infrastructure and automated Day-2 operations—deploy in under 10 minutes and save up to 10 hours/month on routine maintenance.</p>

<h3>Hosting Value You Can Measure</h3>

<p><b>Performance:</b> Dedicated vCPUs (up to 4.2+ GHz), DDR5 RAM, and NVMe SSD storage on up to 40 Gbps network ensure responsive CI/CD pipelines even during concurrent builds. Pre-optimized configurations reduce pipeline execution times by 40-60% compared to standard VPS hosting (varies by workload complexity).</p>

<p><b>Reliability:</b> 99.9% uptime SLA with automated daily backups, disaster recovery snapshots, DDoS protection, and health monitoring alerts. Near-zero downtime repository access during peak development cycles with rolling updates.</p>

<p><b>Ease of Use:</b> One-click deployment on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with pre-configured GitLab, automated SSL via Let's Encrypt, secure firewall rules, and default password reset—no Docker expertise or systemd configuration required. Eliminate up to 5 hours of initial DevOps setup.</p>

<p><b>Day-2 Operations:</b> Automated security patching for GitLab core and components, SSL auto-renewal every 90 days, database backup scheduling, health monitoring with Slack/email alerts—all managed through unified Websoft9 dashboard without terminal commands.</p>

<p><b>Support:</b> 24/7/365 Azure-specialized support team available via ticket, chat, and email for deployment guidance, CI/CD pipeline troubleshooting, and performance optimization.</p>

<p><b>Cost Transparency:</b> Transparent Azure consumption-based billing with MACC credit eligibility. Save 40-60% vs GitLab SaaS for teams with 50+ users (typical enterprise deployments). No hidden infrastructure fees, no surprise overages—predictable costs.</p>

<p><b>Scalability:</b> Vertical scaling for CPU, RAM, and storage as your DevOps needs grow—from 10 repositories to 100+ without re-platforming.</p>
