# About

The Websoft9 Handbook is the operational guide for running the company and is part of our open-source values. This handbook is open to the public, and we welcome your suggestions through [Issues](https://github.com/Websoft9/handbook/issues).

Resources that complement the Handbook include:

- Internal Knowledge Base: Stored in [Enterprise WeChat WeDrive](https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/loginpage_wx?from=myhome)
- **[Digital Systems and Tools](./product/digtal)**: Supporting core business and data
- Empowerment Resource Library: [Think Tank](./company/resource/thinks) + [SaaS](./company/resource/tools) + [Crowdsourcing Platforms](./company/resource/outsource)

The Handbook is the crystallization of collective wisdom and appropriate management thinking and paradigms, so it needs to evolve with the times and avoid becoming rigid dogma.

Thank you to all contributors who have made this Handbook possible.
