<h3>Why Choose Self-Hosted Grafana on Azure?</h3>

Websoft9 eliminates these pain points with production-ready infrastructure and automated Day-2 operations—deploy in under 10 minutes and save up to 8 hours/month on routine maintenance.</p>

<h3>Hosting Value You Can Measure</h3>

<p><b>Performance:</b> Dedicated vCPUs (up to 4.2+ GHz), DDR5 RAM, and NVMe SSD storage on up to 40 Gbps network ensure responsive dashboards even during complex time-series queries. Pre-optimized configurations reduce dashboard load times by 40-60% compared to standard VPS hosting (varies by query complexity).</p>

<p><b>Reliability:</b> 99.9% uptime SLA with automated daily backups, disaster recovery snapshots, DDoS protection, and health monitoring alerts. Near-zero downtime dashboard access during peak incident response with rolling updates.</p>

<p><b>Ease of Use:</b> One-click deployment on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with pre-configured Grafana, automated SSL via Let's Encrypt, secure firewall rules, and default password reset—no Docker expertise or systemd configuration required. Eliminate up to 4 hours of initial DevOps setup.</p>

<p><b>Day-2 Operations:</b> Automated security patching for Grafana core and plugins, SSL auto-renewal every 90 days, database backup scheduling, health monitoring with Slack/email alerts—all managed through unified Websoft9 dashboard without terminal commands.</p>
