Websoft9 eliminates these pain points with production-ready infrastructure and automated Day-2 operations—deploy in under 10 minutes and save up to 15 hours/week on routine maintenance.</p>

<h3>Hosting Value You Can Measure</h3>

<p><b>Performance:</b> Optimized GitLab stack with Redis caching and SSD storage for faster repository operations and CI/CD pipeline execution (up to 40% faster builds, environment-dependent).</p>

<p><b>Reliability:</b> 99.9% uptime SLA with automated hourly backups, disaster recovery, health monitoring, and Azure's built-in DDoS protection—helping ensure your DevOps platform stays accessible 24/7.</p>
