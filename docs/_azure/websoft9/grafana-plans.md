## Plan 4: Multi-Observability Self-Hosted Suite

**PLAN NAME:** Multi-Observability Self-Hosted Suite

**PLAN SUMMARY:** Deploy multiple observability tools on unified infrastructure—add Prometheus, Loki, or OpenTelemetry as needs grow.

**PLAN DESCRIPTION:**
```html
<h3>Building a Complete Observability Platform?</h3>

<p>Deploy and evaluate multiple observability solutions on unified Azure infrastructure. Start with Grafana for visualization, then add Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana Loki for log aggregation, or OpenTelemetry Collector for distributed tracing as your monitoring requirements evolve—all managed through single Websoft9 control panel.</p>

<h3>Available Observability Options</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Grafana:</b> Visual analytics and monitoring dashboards for metrics, logs, and traces with 150+ data source integrations</li>
<li><b>Prometheus:</b> Open-source time-series metrics collection and alerting system with powerful query language (PromQL)</li>
<li><b>Grafana Loki:</b> Log aggregation system designed for cost-effective log storage and search, seamlessly integrated with Grafana</li>
<li><b>OpenTelemetry Collector:</b> Vendor-neutral distributed tracing collection for microservices and cloud-native applications</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Included</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Multi-App Deployment:</b> Deploy Grafana first, then add Prometheus, Loki, or OpenTelemetry when ready—no infrastructure reconfiguration needed</li>
<li><b>Unified Infrastructure:</b> All observability tools share underlying Azure resources, managed through single Websoft9 control panel</li>
<li><b>Flexible Configuration:</b> Allocate CPU, RAM, and storage independently per application based on actual usage patterns</li>
<li><b>Pre-Integrated Stack:</b> Grafana automatically discovers Prometheus metrics, Loki logs, and OpenTelemetry traces—minimal configuration required</li>
<li><b>Support:</b> Architecture consulting for observability stack design + guided migration from existing monitoring tools</li>
<li><b>Data Migration:</b> Export/import tools to transition dashboard configurations between environments or consolidate legacy systems</li>
<li><b>VM Resources:</b> Starts at 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage (recommended for Grafana + 2 additional tools), scalable to 16 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 500GB storage</li>
<li><b>Cost Efficiency:</b> Typically 40-60% lower cost vs separate managed services for each tool (based on 50+ user deployments)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best For</h3>

<p>Organizations building comprehensive observability platforms, teams migrating from proprietary monitoring solutions (Datadog, New Relic) to open-source alternatives, or businesses evaluating best-fit tools for specific use cases (metrics vs logs vs traces). Ideal for platform engineering teams standardizing observability across multiple product teams.</p>
